jdb -connect com.sun.jdi.SocketAttach:hostname=localhost,port=8700
The `jdb` (Java Debugger) command line tool is part of the JDK and is used for debugging Java applications. Here's a quick guide on how to use `jdb` on Windows 11:

1. **Install JDK**: Ensure you have the JDK installed. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2. **Compile Your Java Program**: Compile your Java program with debugging information using the `-g` option:
   ```sh
   javac -g YourProgram.java
   ```

3. **Start Your Java Program with Debugging Enabled**: Launch your Java application with the JVM in debug mode:
   ```sh
   java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000 YourProgram
   ```

4. **Start `jdb` and Attach to the JVM**: Use `jdb` to attach to the running JVM:
   ```sh
   jdb -attach 8000
   ```

5. **Debugging Commands**: Once attached, you can use various `jdb` commands to control the execution of your program, such as:
   - `stop at YourProgram:10` to set a breakpoint at line 10.
   - `run` to start the program.
   - `next` to step to the next line.
   - `print variableName` to print the value of a variable.
